This folder includes a Python program called decision-list.py that implements a decision list classifier to
perform Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD).  More detail in the Programming Assignment - WSD.pdf file.


The System comprises of 3 Python files: calculations.py, DecisionList_KN.py and scoreKN.py.
- The first execution would get the answers by labeling the word 'line' from trained and untrained models.
It needs 2 scripts: calculations.py and DecisionList_KN.py to be in the same folder with 
the provided files:  line-train.xml and line-test.xml
- The script predict the meaning of the word by using  ConditionalFreqDist 
and Condition probability distribution with ELEProbDist with 10 bins.
- The command to execute is:  
$ python DecisionList_KN.py line-train.xml line-test.xml
- After the execution, 2 txt files are created from trained and untrained models:  
my_trained_answers.txt and my_untrained_answer.txt

- Next step is to feed these 2 txt files and compare with the line-answers.txt file to calculate the metrics.
Run this command:  
$ python scoreKN.py my_untrained_answers.txt my_trained_answers.txt line-answers.txt

- The script will calculate Accuracy score, Confusion matrix, Precision and Recall for each entities
by the untrained and trained models and provide the output that look similar like this:

'''
We compare the Accuracy score for each untrained and trained model

   my_untrained_answers Accuracy score: 42.857142857142854%

   my_trained_answers Accuracy score: 84.92063492063492%

Then we inspect further the trained mode to retrieve some metrics
    Confusion matrix for my_trained_answers is
col_0    phone  product
row_0
phone       59        6
product     13       48

    Precision score for each entity in the trained answers:  col_0
Phone      0.819444
Product    0.888889
dtype: float64

    Recall score for each entity in the trained answers:  row_0
phone      0.907692
product    0.786885
dtype: float64
