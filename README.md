# Machine-Learning
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This collection showcases various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) projects I have completed, covering a wide range of topics and applications. The projects include:

Image Detection: Applying deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify objects such as animals and fashion items.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Leveraging advanced DL techniques, including transformer models, to analyze and classify text, such as emotion detection in different languages.
Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch: Implementing foundational ML algorithms like Linear Regression, Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Condensed k-NN entirely from the ground up using Python.
This repository features projects that span academic research, real-life applications, and analyses of current events. It reflects my journey of learning and applying ML and DL concepts to both theoretical problems and practical, real-world scenarios.
